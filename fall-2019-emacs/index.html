		## A Presentation on EMACS

	  <h2>Isn't this the VIM talk?</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li class="fragment"> It was supposed to be</li>
	    <li class="fragment"> I'm sorry if that's what you're here for</li>
	    <li class="fragment"> Blame the other Thomas</li>
	    <li class="fragment"> I mean really, who would rather take an exam than sit around
	      talking about text editors?</li>
	    <li class="fragment"> You can leave if you want</li>
	    <li class="fragment"> But unless you already know you hate EMACS, stick around</li>
	  </ul>

	<section id="cApiTalS">
	  <h2>What is EMACS?</h2>
	  <p class="fragment">Editor MACroS</p>
	  <p class="fragment">YeaH I caN taLK likE THaT ToO!</p>
	  <p class="fragment">No.</p>
	</section>

	<section id="really">
	  <h2>Okay, but really?</h2>
	  <ul>
	  <li>Most commonly GNU Emacs</li>
          <li>Originally just macros for an editor called TECO</li>
          <li>Typically implemented using a Lisp</li>
	  </ul>
	  <small>Aside: you can learn more about things like TECO if you read
	    <i>"Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution"</i> by Steven Levy</small>
	</section>

	<section id="scary">
	  <h2>I heard something about Lisp</h2>
	  <p>Something like...</p>
	  <ul>
	    <li class="fragment">"sexp"?</li>
	    <li class="fragment">Being better than everyone else?</li>
	    <li class="fragment">The formation of an unholy, psyche-shattering contract with Paren,
	      the great and terrible god of parentheses?</li>
	  </ul>
	  <p class="fragment">Well, you aren't wrong, but...</p>
	</section>

	<section id="know-lisp" data-markdown>
	  ## Back to Reality
	  * You only need to know Lisp to write the config file
	  * Lisp isn't that hard to use, especially when editing with Emacs
	  * The entire editor *is* written mostly in Lisp, but you usually aren't aware of it
	  * **Many of you probably already know some Emacs commands, you just don't know it**
	</section>

	<section id="crazy">
	  <section id="crazy-1">
	  <h2>You fool.  You absolute buffoon.  You don't know me!</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li class="fragment">We'll see about that</li>
	    <li class="fragment">Raise your hand if you use bash, zsh, or fish</li>
	    <li class="fragment">Keep them raised unless you've explicitly configured keyboard shortcuts in your shell</li>
	    <li class="fragment">Keep them raised if you know any commands to move around on the command line; ex:</li>
	  </ul>

	  <section id="crazy-2">
	    <ul>
	      <li>Beginning/end of line</li>
	      <li>Forward/backward by character/word</li>
	      <li>Delete a character without the delete key</li>
	      <li>Suspend execution of a program</li>
	      <li>Reverse search through history</li>
	    </ul>
	  </section>
	</section>

	<section id="hope" data-markdown>
	  ## I hope there are hands still raised
	  * You all know some Emacs movement commands already!
	  * Why is it this way?
	  * GNU readline
	   * Wraps many text interfaces in GNU and other software
	   * Ex: Emacs, nano, bash, Python, etc.
	</section>

	<section id="keys">
	  <section id="keys-1" data-markdown>
	  ## All your modifiers are mine
	  The absolute basic key combos you'll need:
	  * C-f and C-b: go forward and backward one character
	  * M-f and M-b: go forward and backward one word
	  * C-n and C-p: go down and up one line
	  * C-a and C-e: go to the beginning and end of a line
	  * M-&gt; and M-&lt;: go to the beginning and end of the buffer
	  * C-x u: undo
	  * C-SPC: begin/end selecting text
	  </section>
	  <section id="keys-2" data-markdown>
	  * C-w and M-w: cut and copy selection
	  * C-y: paste text
	  * C-k: kill a line
	  * C-h: open help
	  * C-s and C-r: forward and reverse search
	  * C-x C-f: open a file
	  * C-x C-s: save current buffer
	  * C-x s: save all buffers  
	  * C-x C-c: quit
	  </section>

	  <h2>I'm bored now, stop talking about keys</h2>
	  <ul>
	  <li class="fragment">Okay</li>
	  <li class="fragment">Just remember to try these in your shell sometime</li>
	  <li class="fragment">I swear if I see one more person clear a shell with "clear" instead
	    of C-l, I'm going to insert my head into a wall.</li>
	  <li class="fragment">No more arrow keys either, just use C-n and C-l</li>
	  <li class="fragment"><b>Serious: the whole idea is to keep your hands on the keyboard as much as
	    possible.</b></li>
	  </ul>

	  <section id="what-else-1">
	  <h2>What else can we do?</h2>
	  <ul>
	    <li class="fragment">Useful things:</li>
	    <ul>

	<section id="even-more" data-markdown>
	  ## Even more
	  * You can use VIM keybindings in Emacs with things like Spacemacs and Evil mode
	  * You can write your own packages
	  * You can edit your config file to tune Emacs to your liking
  	  * I can show you what Emacs looks like for me if you want
	  * Generally, anything you can program, Emacs can do!
	</section>

	<section id="end" data-markdown>
	  ## The End
	  * Thank you all for staying
	  * If you want to know more, you can try talking to me
	  * I would not consider myself an expert by any means though
	  * Unless you profess extreme zealotry for a different editor, I'd recommend
	    trying out Emacs for a few weeks sometime in the future
